This is my very first blog post here 🎉\nI wanted to start by sharing a big part of my journey — how I went from juggling two jobs to becoming AWS Certified (Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect Associate, Developer Associate).\n📚 How It Started # Back when I began this journey, I knew cloud was the future. The challenge?\nI was already working full time as a Team Lead (managing ~30 people) and had a second job on the side. Time was not on my side.\nInstead of giving up, I decided to turn Toronto traffic into my motivation.\n🚶 After work, instead of driving straight home and getting stuck in traffic (which drains your soul), I’d walk to the Toronto Public Library and study there for 4–5 hours every evening.\nThose walks kept my energy up, and the quiet library hours became my “study sanctuary.”\n🎓 The Courses \u0026amp; Practice # I leaned heavily on some fantastic resources:\n📘 Stephane Maarek’s Udemy Courses (link) — detailed, hands-on AWS content 📗 Neal Davis’ Course for AWS Cloud Practitioner (link) — clear and beginner-friendly 📝 Tutorial Dojo Practice Exams (link) — helped me test knowledge under real exam pressure Each exam (Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect, Developer) I managed to pass within 4–6 weeks each — while still working two jobs.\n🛠️ Study Techniques That Worked # Here’s what really helped me stick through:\nHands-on practice → I didn’t just watch lectures, I spun up AWS services (Lambda, S3, CloudFormation, etc.) Consistent routine → daily study, even if short, beats random long weekends Walking to study → small physical habit gave me mental energy Note-taking \u0026amp; quick reviews → helped me retain tricky concepts (IAM policies, VPC setups, etc.) 💡 Applying AWS at Work # As a Team Lead, I didn’t want my AWS learning to stay theoretical. So I:\nBuilt small internal websites to automate routine tasks for my team Leveraged AWS microservices to streamline processes End result? My team of 30 loved it, and I built real-world confidence while studying That combination of cert prep + real-world application made the concepts stick.\n🎯 Final Thoughts # Earning those certifications wasn’t easy — especially with 2 jobs, late-night study sessions, and long walks in Toronto winters. But it taught me:\n👉 With consistency + hands-on practice, 4–6 weeks is enough to crush an AWS exam.\n👉 Walking into the library every day was just as important as logging into the AWS console.\n👉 Most importantly, the journey gave me the confidence to pursue a career in Cloud \u0026amp; DevOps Engineering.\nThanks for reading my very first post 🙌\nMore to come soon — projects, study notes, and cloud experiments.\n✍️ If you’re studying for AWS exams right now — keep pushing, stay consistent, and get your hands dirty with real implementations. You’ve got this 💪\n","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/first-post/","section":"Blog 📝","summary":"","title":"My AWS Certification Journey 🚀","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/study-tips/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Study Tips","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" The Terraform Adventure: How I Automated My Cloud 🚀 # Hey there! 👋 Gather around for a story about how I dove headfirst into the world of Infrastructure as Code using Terraform. Spoiler alert: It’s been a wild ride full of learning, coffee ☕, and a touch of magic 🪄.\nChapter 1: The Dawn of a New Project 🌅 # Once upon a time, I was managing cloud resources the old-fashioned way—clicking around consoles and battling with manual setup. It was slow, error-prone, and frankly, not very fun. Then, one day, the shining beacon of Terraform called my name.\nI knew this was my chance to automate everything. To write code that could build my cloud infrastructure like waving a magic wand. ✨ But little did I know, every magic trick takes practice.\nChapter 2: Mapping Out the Realm 🗺️ # Before writing a single line of Terraform, I had to sketch my infrastructure blueprint. Picture this: multiple VPCs, public and private subnets, a bastion host guarding the gates, and a fleet of servers ready to scale on demand. A real digital kingdom!\nI grabbed my favorite drawing tool, created a neat diagram (soon to be shared 😉), and started plotting my Terraform script strategies.\nChapter 3: Building Blocks and Modules 🧱 # Terraform modules became my trusty companions. Like Lego bricks 🚀, each module could be reused and customized — networking, compute resources, IAM policies, you name it! This modular magic helped keep my code clean and scalable.\nHowever, not all was smooth sailing. I quickly learned that managing the dependency graph — making sure things build in the right order — was like solving a puzzle with moving pieces. 🧩 Patience and lots of debugging saved the day.\nChapter 4: The Remote State Saga 📡 # One of the biggest challenges was handling the Terraform state—basically the brain of my infrastructure. Without remote state management, I risked conflicts and overwrites.\nSetting up a remote backend with locking capabilities was like adding a loyal guardian who kept my state safe and sound. Now my team and I could collaborate without fear of disaster. Together, we prospered. 🌱\nChapter 5: Workspaces for Kingdoms 🏰 # Different environments meant different kingdoms: development, staging, and production. I used Terraform workspaces to manage these realms efficiently.\nSwitching between workspace was like stepping through portals to different parts of my cloud empire. Each workspace independent but unified under my command. It felt pretty epic. ⚔️\nChapter 6: The Future Frontier 🌌 # My Terraform journey is far from over. I’ve got plans to integrate Terraform Cloud for automatic checks and policy enforcement. I dream of CI/CD pipelines automating deployments like clockwork. 🕰️\nAnd there’s still plenty to explore—monitoring, alerting, and beyond. The adventure continues!\nFeel free to check out the full Terraform project and all its files on GitHub: https://github.com/gursimran531/bhujhang_website.git\nTakeaways and Wisdom 💡 # Automation saves time ⏰ and reduces risk Modular code = scalable infrastructure Remote state is essential for collaboration 🤝 Workspaces help manage environments neatly Terraform isn’t magic; it’s practice + patience + coffee ☕ Thanks for joining me on this story!
